/*
How do we debug?

We can use console.log statements to print things to our console.
But we need to tell it what to print, we do that by specifying what we want
between the parentheses in our statement:

*/

console.log("Hello world!")

let olderDaughter = "Madelyn"
let youngerDaughter = "Finley"

console.log(olderDaughter)
console.log(incomingDaughter)


// We'll get into more about what we're doing over the coming days, but for now
// we can think of it as specifying what we want to happen console.log and what
// we want it to happen with "Hello world!"

// We can also add comments to our code. Comments are a way of explaining our
// ideas and logic to ourselves and other developers that may read our code. 

// We can specify single line comments with a double slash //
/*
Or we can write
multiline comments
like this 
*/
// These aren't just useful for future references for what your code is doing, 
// writing your thoughts out in comments can help you think through a problem
// and work towards a solution

// Errors
// errors are your best friend!
// console.log(errors)

// It will seem daunting at first, but within every error that you get in your
// console is some morsel of truth that will lead you towards what's wrong.

// Early in your development career these errors will be fairly straightforward
// such as the one we just saw, but get comfortable reading and parsing the 
// output. Developing the ability to sift through an error and find the lines
// that it points to will be a valuable skill throughout your career as a 
// developer
